    "Assumption: ARIMA models assume that the residuals are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",

    "Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: ARIMA models assume a linear relationship between past observations and the current observation.\n",

    "Seasonality: Monthly sales data often exhibits seasonality, which means that sales patterns repeat themselves at regular intervals, like yearly or quarterly. ARIMA models, including SARIMA, are well-suited to capture both short-term and long-term seasonality in the data.\n",

    "Trends: ARIMA models can also account for trends in the data. If there's a noticeable increasing or decreasing trend in sales over time, an ARIMA model can capture and project that trend.\n",

    "Autocorrelation: Sales data may show autocorrelation, where the current month's sales are related to the sales in previous months. ARIMA models are designed to capture these autocorrelations.\n",
